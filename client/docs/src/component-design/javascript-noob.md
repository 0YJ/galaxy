### Classes exist but they aren't as important as you may be used to.

You may come from a class-based programming background and think that your first step should be to
make a class hierchy that does the thing you want. It doesn't help that Vue superficially looks like
a class definition, (even though what you're really doing is configuring an Observable tree). 

### Javascript is a pretty functional language. 

Javascript is largely a functional language. Its class support is limited and less useful, and
unless we switch to Typescript, we don't even have interfaces or typing, arguably the most useful
parts of a class-based language. 

In general, you will get more mileage out of javascript by embracing functional programming
approaches because that is what Javascript is good at.
