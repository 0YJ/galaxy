Highlights
===========================================================

**Conda auto initialization is enabled by default**
  After updating to 17.01 and upon starting Galaxy the Conda package manager will be installed automatically
  within the Galaxy's workspace. This will enable your Galaxy to install tool dependencies using Conda
  e.g. scientific `BioConda <https://bioconda.github.io/>`__ channel.

**New interface for user preferences**
  User preferences menu has been reworked for clarity and consistency.
  Thanks to `@anuprulez <https://github.com/anuprulez>`__ and `@bgruening <https://github.com/bgruening>`__.
  Implemented in `Pull Request 3118`_.

**Support for gzipped fastq formats**
  You can now upload compressed files without being unpacked. Existing tools will work as before and future
  tools will be able to consume archives and save space in your quota.
  Thanks to `@mvdbeek <https://github.com/mvdbeek>`__.
  Implemented in `Pull Request 3145`_.
