Highlights
===========================================================

**Conda auto initialization is enabled by default**
  After updating to 17.01 and upon starting Galaxy the Conda package manager will be installed automatically
  within the Galaxy's workspace. This will enable your Galaxy to install tool dependencies from Conda channels
  such as `BioConda <https://bioconda.github.io/>`__. Such channels are already being used for new and updated tools by IUC
  and we suggest adopting this tool dependency resolution method to all tool developers instead of Tool Shed package
  recipes - which are now considered deprecated.
  Please see the details at the admin `documentation <https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/conda_faq.html>`__

**New interface for user preferences**
  User preferences menu has been reworked for clarity and consistency.
  Thanks to `@anuprulez <https://github.com/anuprulez>`__ and `@bgruening <https://github.com/bgruening>`__.
  Implemented in `Pull Request 3118`_.

**Support for compressed FASTQ formats**
  You can now upload compressed (with gzip or bzip2) FASTQ files without them being unpacked automatically (as it was until now).
  For this to work you have to select the proper type when uploading (e.g. instead of ``fastqsanger`` you select ``fastqsanger.gz``
  or ``fastqsanger.bz2`` for compressed files).
  Existing tools will work as before and future tools will be able to consume archives and save space in your quota.
  Thanks to `@abretaud <https://github.com/abretaud>`__, `@ashvark <https://github.com/ashvark>`__, `@jvolkening <https://github.com/jvolkening>`__, and `@mvdbeek <https://github.com/mvdbeek>`__.
  Implemented in `Pull Request 3145`_, `PullRequest 3510`_ and `PullRequest 3514`_.
