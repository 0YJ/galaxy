Highlights
===========================================================

**Feature1**
  Feature description.

**Track your original datasets more easily**
  When you add certain tags with a ``#`` in front (e.g. ``#sample_A``) to datasets they will be propagated
  through toolruns to subsequent datasets helping you to better orientate within history.
  Implemented in `Pull Request 3704`_ `Pull Request 3718`_ `Pull Request 3719`_ `Pull Request 3760`_ `Pull Request 3868`_ `Pull Request 3979`_

**Drag & Drop datasets into tool inputs**
  Interface now allows dragging datasets from history panel into the content selectors of the tool form.
  Implemented in `Pull Request 3871`_.

New Configuration Options
===========================================================

Below are the newly added options you can configure in ``galaxy.ini``.
To see the whole sample file visit our GitHub `repository <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/release_17.05/config/galaxy.ini.sample>`__.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Set to True to enable monitoring of the tool_data and shed_tool_data_path
    # directories. If changes in tool data table files are found, the tool data
    # tables for that data manager are automatically reloaded.
    # Watchdog ( https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog ) must be installed and
    # available to Galaxy to use this option. Other options include 'auto'
    # which will attempt to use the watchdog library if it is available but won't
    # fail to load Galaxy if it is not and 'polling' which will use a less
    # efficient monitoring scheme that may work in wider range of scenarios
    # than the watchdog default.
    #watch_tool_data_dir = False

    # To run interactive environment containers in Docker Swarm mode (on an
    # existing swarm), set this option to True and set `docker_connect_port` in the
    # IE plugin config (ini) file(s) of any IE plugins you have enabled and ensure
    # that you are not using any `docker run`-specific options in your plugins'
    # `command_inject` options (swarm mode services run using `docker service
    # create`, which has a different and more limited set of options). This option
    # can be overridden on a per-plugin basis by using the `swarm_mode` option in
    # the plugin's ini config file.
    #interactive_environment_swarm_mode = False

    # Galaxy can run a "swarm manager" service that will monitor utilization of the
    # swarm and provision/deprovision worker nodes as necessary. The service has
    # its own configuration file.
    #swarm_manager_config_file = config/swarm_manager_conf.yml

    # Log to graphite
    # Graphite is an external statistics aggregator (https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon)
    # Enabling the following options will cause galaxy to log request timing and
    # other statistics to the configured graphite instance. The graphite_prefix is
    # useful if you are running multiple Galaxy instances and want to segment
    # statistics between them within the same aggregator.
    #graphite_host=
    #graphite_port=2003
    #graphite_prefix=galaxy

    # Enable the new container interface for Interactive Environments
    #enable_beta_containers_interface = False
