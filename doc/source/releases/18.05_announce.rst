Highlights
===========================================================

* The styling of many components of the Galaxy UI has been subtlety improved as the result
  of upgrading to Bootstrap 4. The upgrade process was a large community effort
  with commits from six contributors and testing and bug reports from many others. A huge
  thanks goes out to everyone who helped - it is a great step forward toward a more
  standardized Galaxy client infrastructure built on reactive `VueJS <https://vuejs.org/>`__
  components. Read more about whats new and changed in the underlying Bootstrap 4 JavaScript
  library `here <http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/>`__.

  `Pull Request 5807`_, `Galaxy Project Board for Bootstrap 4
  <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/projects/10>`__.

* Support for chunked and resumable file uploads out-of-the-box. This should effectively
  eliminate browser-based limitations on the size of files that can be uploaded to Galaxy.

  `Pull Request 5516`_

* The Galaxy UI features a powerful new widget for manipulating lists of rules for processing metadata
  that can be used to describe the upload of arbitrarily complex collections as well as individual
  datasets. These rules can be used to build collections from lists of URLs, FTP directory contents,
  data library folders, and tabular sample sheets or exports from external data sources. The same
  technique can be applied to the metadata of and existing collections enabling very flexible
  filtering, sorting, relabelling, grouping, flattening, and general re-organization of collections.
  This client widget is backed by a powerful new `hierarchical upload API <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/5220>`__ and `a new collection
  operation tool <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/5819>`__.

  Check out `this tutorial <https://github.com/jmchilton/training-material/blob/rules/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-rules/tutorial.md>`__ describing new techniques for loading
  large numbers of datasets and complex collections into Galaxy.

* The charts and generic visualization frameworks have been merged together into a single coherent
  framework. A new masthead option for listing and searching all available visualizations together
  is now available.
