Highlights
===========================================================

**Performance and User Experience Improvements**
We made Galaxy more lively and responsive. Homepage, published workflows, published/saved histories, and data libraries should all load much faster now. Importing data from FTP will also take less of your time.
We achieved this by optimising queries, implementing cache, rethinking presentation, and adding progress bars and loading indicators where needed.

Breaking Changes
================

We have reworked the Galaxy Webhook interface so if you have custom webhooks at your instance
you need to take the following steps in order to fix them:

1. Rename the main config file: <name>.yml -> config.yml
2. In the config file, rename the name attribute: name -> id
3. Put all files into the plugin's root folder, which should contain only four files: ``config.yml`` (mandatory), ``__init__.py`` (optional), ``script.js`` (optional), ``styles.css`` (optional)

Deprecation Notices

The following features that have been deprecated in the past releases are being removed in 18.01:
