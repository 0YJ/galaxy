Highlights
===========================================================

**Shift of Galaxy tool dependencies to Conda**
  Galaxy admins obtained the ability to install Galaxy tool's
  dependencies using the Conda package manager. Also starting
  with this release Galaxy will automatically install
  Conda at startup.
  See `PR #2554 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2554>`__
  and `PR #2759 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2759>`__

**Dynamic tool destinations**
  Our friends from Canada National Microbiology Laboratory enhanced
  Galaxy with feature that allows dynamic mapping of tools to destinations
  based on finer grained admin-specified rules.
  See `PR #2579 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2579>`__

**Galaxy chat**
  Admins can now plug in the included communication server to enable
  users of their instance to use real-time chat within the Galaxy interface.
  See `PR #2515 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2515>`__
