Highlights
===========================================================

**New development stack**
  Galaxy release 21.09 will ship with a new web framework (`fastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`__),
  `Celery <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/index.html>`__ task queue and process management using `circus <https://circus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. You can try out this new stack now by running ``APP_WEBSERVER=dev./run.sh``.

**Celery for long running tasks**
  Galaxy can now run certain tasks in the background. The Celery workers are
  currently not required, but if activated can perform certain long running tasks,
  such as creating history export archives. Celery tasks will bridge the gap between
  rapid requests that can be handled during a web request and jobs that require extensive
  and relatively slow setup. (`Pull Request 11789`_, `Pull Request 11772`_, `Pull Request 11720`_)

**More robust selection of job handlers**
  Job throughput can be increased by starting Galaxy with multiple external job
  handler processes. Jobs were traditionally assigned to a job handler process
  by the web handler or workflow handler process that created the job. Since
  Release 19.01 Galaxy has supported additional mechanisms that use database
  serialization techniques to let job handlers assign processes to themselves.
  This mechanism is more robust and doesn't require that all job handler
  processes be alive and known by the web handler process. Galaxy now determines
  the best method for assigning jobs based on the database in use, if the assignment
  method is not set explicitly. Older job assignment methods will be removed in Galaxy
  release 21.09. For more details see the `Job Handler Assignment Methods section <https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_21.05/admin/scaling.html#job-handler-assignment-methods>`__
  of the Galaxy documentation. ( `Pull Request 11792`_)

Upcoming Deprecation Notices
===========================================================

**Deprecation of support for Python 3.6 in Galaxy release 21.09**
  This Galaxy release (21.05) will be the last release that supports Python 3.6 or newer.
  We encourage updating to a newer Python if possible.

**Deprecation of uwsgi and paste**
  This Galaxy release (21.05) will be the last release that supports the WSGI standard,
  and with it uwsgi and paste. From release 21.09 Galaxy will be an ASGI application.
  We will update documentation and playbooks during the upcoming development cycle to
  enable a smooth transition.
