Highlights
===========================================================

**Singularity**
  Tool execution using the HPC-friendly container technology `Singularity <http://singularity.lbl.gov/>`__
  is now supported. Custom containers can be specified by the Galaxy admin on a per job destination basis
  or standardized containers can be built or downloaded corresponding to Conda requirements automatically
  using the mulled toolkit built into Galaxy (just like is possible for Docker). For more information
  checkout `this presentation <http://bit.ly/gcc-biocontainers>`__ from the 2017 Galaxy Community Conference.

**Download entire collection**
  Downloading whole colections is now possible from the history interface. `Pull Request 4098`_
