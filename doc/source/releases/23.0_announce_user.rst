Highlights
===========================================================

Themes!
-------

Show off your colours in Galaxy 23.0 with the ability to choose your own theme! As as a user you will be able to select between a number of built-in themes. Server administrators may choose to provide additional themes for their users. If your admin has enabled this feature, you will find it under User â†’ Preferences, just look for the bright red "New!"

   :alt: The top bar of Galaxy is shown across four different themes in a single image, diagonal cuts joining the images so it looks like a continuous Galaxy screenshot. The four themes shown are the progress pride flag in the masthead, the classic Galaxy dark blue, a black theme with pink highlights, and then a lighter blue theme.

New Font
--------

You might have noticed Galaxy looking a wee bit different. The 0s and Os are now more distinctive, as well as a host of other characters, thanks to us switching to `Atkinson Hyperlegible <https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont>`__, a font that should be a *lot* friendlier for folks with visual impairments. In general this font is much easier to read for everyone and we're excited for it!

New History Multi-view
----------------------

The old history multi-view which loaded every history and every dataset is now gone. In its place is a much faster and easier to navigate history multi-view which lets you select just the histories you want to look at, without the distraction of your other analyses! Now you can focus on the relevant data.

New Tool Search
---------------

Many of us over the years have struggled to find just the tool we were looking for. This latest release has a number of improvements specifically to make tool search better, and on top of that a whole new advanced tool search!

Power User Features
===========================================================

Are you a long time Galaxy user looking to up-skill into a real power user? Check out these new features to take your skills to the next level.

Faster Upload
-------------

Simply drag files from your desktop into Galaxy and they'll start uploading immediately! It's faster than ever to start analysing your data.

Drag and Drop Between Histories
-------------------------------

With the new advent of the new Multi-History mentioned above, we now also can drag and drop between histories! And no longer are you restricted from dragging into the current history, instead you can drag files back and forth between all histories as well.

Change the Datatype of a Collection
-----------------------------------

It's easier than ever to change the datatype of every dataset in a collection using the pencil icon. Previously this could be achieved through the Apply Rules tool, however now it can be done just like with individual datasets.

RO-Crate / Biocompute Export
----------------------------

Are you interested in publishing workflow artefacts? You can do that in one of two formats now, RO-Crate and BioCompute Object. These are both standards based efforts to package research data and metadata. Read more about `RO-Crate <https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/>`__ and `BioCompute Objects <https://biocomputeobject.org/>`__. You'll need to have a remote file source configured (e.g. FTP or Dropbox) to use it.



Workflow Report - Collapsible Boxes
-----------------------------------

Based on user feedback of what features were missing from workflow reports, support for collapsing large boxes has been added to the Workflow Reports editor. Simply add ``collapse="Your Box Title"`` and large elements will be hidden with just a clickable box titled "Your Box Title". Great for including large graphs or tables that may be important, but not relevant to show initially.
