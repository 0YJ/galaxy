Highlights
===========================================================

**The New History is Here**

After years of effort by the development team and community contributors, the new history is finally here. It's a big improvement over the old history interface, both technically and in terms of user experience, but it might take some getting used to. It has a lot of great new features like:

- A quick switcher, letting you switch between recent histories
- Easily find dataset inputs
- Improved history search interface

Check it out now!

   :alt: Screenshot of a history, the top most dataset is expanded and a "sitemap" icon is clicked which is showing inputs for that dataset. Each of those inputs has a small upward arrow next to the dataset number. The 'end' dataset of those inputs has a checkmark icon next to the dataset number. The history is titled the beta history and there are a lot of new buttons at the top.

**Storage Dashboard** (beta)

Have you ever been over your quotum? 250 GB sure goes fast! Now with the new Storage Dashboard you can get a quick overview of ways to help clean up deleted datasets and recover some of that quotum allocation. This is a beta version of this interface, let us know if you have any issues. In future versions, it will be expanded to help you understand how your allocation is being used, and which histories and datasets should be cleaned up first.

**Bulk History Operations**

The new history allows for improved bulk operations, selecting dozens or hundreds of datasets to retag or change their dbkey automatically, a process that used to require using collections or doing them one by one.

**Workflow Improvements**

You can now see all invocations of a specific workflow, across all of your histories.

.. figure:: images/22.05-invocation-menu.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the drop down menu on a specific workflow, showing an invocation button. This is accessible via the workflow name in the workflow list.

This is especially useful if you run a single workflow across multiple datasets, and keep them nicely separated in multiple histories. You can see all of the results in a single centralised location.

.. figure:: images/22.05-invocation-list.png
   :alt: List of workflow invocations for a specific workflow named Annotation Pipeline. A single invocation is visible along with the results and associated report in the normal workflow invocation view that appears after submitting a job.

Additional workflow improvements have been made, e.g. numbering of steps in a workflow. Improvements have been made to the internal representation of the workflow that should make the saved `.ga` and `.gxwf.yml` files easier to compare across changes.

Workflows can also now be zoomed via scrolling, this interface should be more familiar for anyone who has used Google Maps:

**Saved Rules**

Do you use the Rule Based Uploader? (If not, `learn how today! <https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/upload-rules/tutorial.html>`__) The RBU now has a very convenient recently used rule listing, sorted by how recently they were used. You can hover over each entry to also list a preview of what steps were done in that RBU invocation:

.. figure:: images/22.05-rbu.png
   :alt: Rule based uploader interface showing a list of recently used rules. The mouse hovers over the first showing a short description of the rule mentioning filtering.

**Scratchbook Upgraded**

The scratchbook has been updated to a newer implementation. Now your views of datasets can overlap, you have much more freedom in the size of each window, and you can minimize datasets like minimizing a window to the taskbar in Windows.

They now appear at the bottom of the window"></iframe>

**OpenAPI Docs**

The Galaxy API has been going through a long upgrade to FastAPI, which allows us to generate OpenAPI documentation. If you're an API consumer, either via BioBlend or via another system, you can use this to see all of the APIs available from Galaxy and try them out live.

.. figure:: images/22.05-openapi.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the OpenAPI autogenerated documentation listing all of the available Galaxy APIs. In each collapsed section there is an interface to try out the APIs with various values, live, in Galaxy.
