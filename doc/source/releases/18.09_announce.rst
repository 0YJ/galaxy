Highlights
===========================================================

**Extensive Workflow Enhancements**
  Workflows got a lot of love this time around, with new runtime parameters for
  subworkflows, exposed workflow versions, and zoom capability in the editor, to
  name a few.  There were also a number of usability enhancements including
  better labeling, links, overhauled workflow import interfaces, and many more.

**Group Tags**
  Galaxy now contains powerful new features for multiple factor analysis of collections
  of datasets. The concept of group tags has been added to Galaxy. These are a special
  class of tags that describe key-value pairs that can be attached to the contents of a
  collection during upload or using collection operation tools. These tags can describe
  multiple sets of variables for the contents of a collection. Once set, these tags can
  be consumed intelligently by tools that need to divide collections into multiple
  overlapping factors or sets of datasets. A special thanks to `@mvdbeek <https://github.com/mvdbeek>`__ for devising and implementing this approach.

**Python 3 Beta Support**
  After almost 3 years of work and more than 100 pull requests, we are proud
  to announce the Beta-stage support for running Galaxy under Python 3.
  Lint, unit, API, framework, integration and Selenium tests all pass, time
  for you to give it a try and report any bug you find!

Unauthorized File System Operations via New Upload API
------------------------------------------------------

Tracked as GX-2018-0006. Servers running Galaxy 18.05 should be updated as soon as possible.
See `the public announcement for full details
<http://announce.list.galaxyproject.org/GX-2018-0006-Unauthorized-File-System-Operations-via-New-Upload-API-td4639432.html>`__.

Deprecation Notice
==================

With 19.01, all Galaxy users will be forced to have a username.  This
requirement has been enforced on user creation for years, though we have never
taken steps to coerce users created in the past who did not have one.  The
19.01 release will come with a migration script that will coerce this in the
database, which will allow us to have consistent handling of this field.
