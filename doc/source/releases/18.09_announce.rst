Highlights
===========================================================

**Extensive Workflow Enhancements**
  Workflows got a lot of love this time around, with new runtime parameters for
  subworkflows, exposed workflow versions, and zoom capability in the editor, to
  name a few.  There were also a number of usability enhancements including
  better labeling, links, overhauled workflow import interfaces, and many more.

**Group Tags**
  Galaxy now contains powerful new features for multiple factor analysis of collections
  of datasets. The concept of group tags has been added to Galaxy. These are a special
  class of tags that describe key-value pairs that can be attached to the contents of a
  collection during upload or using collection operation tools. These tags can describe
  multiple sets of variables for the contents of a collection. Once set, these tags can
  be consumed intelligently by tools that need to divide collections into multiple
  overlapping factors or sets of datasets. A special thanks to `@mvdbeek <https://github.com/mvdbeek>`__ for devising and implementing this approach.

**Python 3 Beta Support**
  After almost 3 years of work and more than 100 pull requests, we are proud
  to announce the Beta-stage support for running Galaxy under Python 3.
  Lint, unit, API, framework, integration and Selenium tests all pass, time
  for you to give it a try and report any bug you find!
