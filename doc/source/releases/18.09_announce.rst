Highlights
===========================================================

**OpenID Connect Support**
  Galaxy now supports using OpenID Connect for user login, relying on trusted
  identity providers to manage authentication.  This is intended to replace the
  old (and mostly deprecated, on the web) OpenID 2.0 logins.  Read more at
  https://galaxyproject.org/admin/authentication/

    `https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/4474`

**Extensive Workflow Enhancements**
  Workflows got a lot of love this time around, with new runtime parameters for
  subworkflows, exposed workflow versions, and zoom capability in the editor, to
  name a few.  There were also a number of usability enhancements including
  better labeling, links, overhauled workflow import interfaces, and many more.
