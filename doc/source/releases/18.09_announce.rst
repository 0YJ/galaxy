Highlights
===========================================================

**Group Tag Support**
  Forthcoming text.

**Extensive Workflow Enhancements**
  Workflows got a lot of love this time around, with new runtime parameters for
  subworkflows, exposed workflow versions, and zoom capability in the editor, to
  name a few.  There were also a number of usability enhancements including
  better labeling, links, overhauled workflow import interfaces, and many more.

**Python 3 Beta Support**
  After almost 3 years of work and more than 100 pull requests, we are proud
  to announce the Beta-stage support for running Galaxy under Python 3.
  Lint, unit, API, framework, integration and Selenium tests all pass, time
  for you to give it a try and report any bug you find!

(TODO: Add notes)

Deprecation Notice
==================

With 19.01, all Galaxy users will be forced to have a username.  This
requirement has been enforced on user creation for years, though we've never
taken steps to coerce users created in the past who did not have one.  The
19.01 release will come with a migration script that will coerce this in the
database, which will allow us to have consistent handling of this field.
