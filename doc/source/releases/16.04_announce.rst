Deprecation Notices
===========================================================
API for history contents, show:
  * **api_type**: removed and unavailable (was :code:`file` and constant across HDAs)
  * **display_apps**, **display_types**, **visualization**: removed from the default :code:`detailed` view but still available by calling url with
   ``?keys=display_apps,display_types,visualization``

API histories (removed from the available serialized data on all calls):
  * **state, state_details, state_ids** - can be replaced by specifically requesting a single array of contents, each containing :code:`{ id, state, deleted, visible }`

Security
===========================================================
Due to security fixes on the Mercurial_ side we had to update the hg version that
both Galaxy and TS depend on because the fixes have not been backported to older versions.
However this has broken the TS's ``hg push`` functionality as Mercurial changed their bundle
format in a non-compatible manner. Given that we deprecated the ``hg push`` API
functionality back in in 15.10 we decided to disable it fully from 16.01 (retroactively).

**Only Tool Sheds newer than 16.01 should be deployed form now on.**
