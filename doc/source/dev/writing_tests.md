# Writing Tests for Galaxy

## Sources of Documentation

Over the last several years, the most up-to-date documentation on the
structure and running of Galaxy tests has been in the help text for
run_tests.sh script shipped with Galaxy (``./run_tests.sh --help``).
High-level information on Galaxy's CI process can be found in the
[Galaxy Code Architecture Slides](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/architecture/slides.html)
and the corresponding [YouTube playlist](https://bit.ly/gx-arch-vids).
Some more specifics on running and writing Galaxy client unit tests
can be found in ``client/README.md`` of the Galaxy codebase.
