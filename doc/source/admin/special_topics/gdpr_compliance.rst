GDPR Compliance
===============

With the new GDPR regulations that are in effect as of May 25, 2018, there are
some extra steps you as an admin need to take to protect your Galaxy.

Audience
--------

Anyone with users from the EU.

The Galaxy Project cares about privacy preserving regulations and meeting the
requirements within. Many smaller companies in the US are choosing to block the
EU completely, this is obviously not ideal. We have attempted to make
compliance as easy as possible so you can continue to serve EU users.
